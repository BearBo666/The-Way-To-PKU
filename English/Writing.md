**辞职信（道歉信）**

Dear Mr.Wang,
		It is with much regret to let you know that I'm resigning from my position as an editor for Fashion&Design.

​		I have been delighted to work with you and other colleagues for the past two months. This job not only is the means of making living for me, but brings me plenty of valuable experience. However, though so many exciting challenges I have faced in my job, I feel like it fails to live up to my expectation, which is by no mean enjoyable.

​		For a long time, I have believed in interest enables me to focus on my business, which in turn gives rise to the final success. Therefore, after much consideration, I decide to resign from my current job, to stand at the threshold of new career.

​		At the end, I sincerely apologize to you.

​		With strong desire to contribute to Project Hope, I'm writing to find a child in a poor area who needs financial aid. I would be more than happy if you could recommend me a candidate who is a left-behind child in a poor-stricken area.

​		In a series of reports about left-behind children, What impressed me most is their desperate and helpless eyes. Therefore, in the hope that such children could be bathed in love and sunshine, I'd like to cover the tuition and living expense for him or her.

​		Thank you, and your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.

**给图书馆提建议（建议信）**

Dear Sir or Madam,

​		As a regular user, I highly appreciate your excellent service, from which I have benefited a great deal. Nevertheless, the following suggestions, I believe, are conducive to the further improvement of library.

​		The primary task is establishing a network platform providing teaching courseware and materials, on which students can search whatever references available. Simultaneously, against the background of the age of information, the absence of electronics reading rooms is not in absolute condemnation, but the presence of them is a definite sign of improvement. Moreover, it will be more convenient if there are some self-checkout machines.

​		I hope my suggestions will be given a lot of thought. Your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.																								<span style="float:right;">Your truly</span>

**把加拿大房东的CD带走了（道歉信）**

Dear Bob,

​		I'm writing the letter to express my sincere apologies to you.

​		To begin with, I'd like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt appreciation to you for the kind assistance you rendered my during my stay in Canada. During my stay in Canada, I borrowed a CD of Beethoven's symphonies from you. Unfortunately, when I returned home, I found to my surprise that the CD was in my personal baggage due to my carelessness.

​		To solve the problem, I would like to send this CD to you by Express Mail Service. Once again, please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences that I have caused. I hope this will settle the matter to your satisfaction.

**给编辑写信，阐述你关于限塑令未成功实施的看法（建议信）**

Dear Editors,

​		I have been reading your newspaper for many years with great enthusiasm and interest. Regarding the issue of disposable plastic bags, it is my view that limiting the use of such bags is of the utmost significance.

​		To crack this hard nut, I would like to propose several practical recommendations as follows. First and foremost, it is imperative for us to ban the free use of disposable plastic bags. In addition, we should develop possible alternative to replace them, such as paper or cloth bags. Last but not least, plastic bags should be offered at a higher price in department stores or supermarkets.

​		I hope you will find the above proposals constructive and I would like to discuss this matter in further detail. Your prompt attention to my suggestions would be highly appreciated.

**推荐一部最喜欢的电影（推荐信）**

Dear Mary,

​		Knowing that you are struggling to study American history, I do not hesitate to recommend you the film 12 Years a Slave, a big box-office success and the winner of three Academy Awards.

​		The film is an adaption of the memoir written by Solomon, an African-American kidnapped and sold into slavery. Its faithfulness to the culture and history of American——the main reason of my recommendation——may largely facilitate your study.  Moreover, its gripping plots, exquisite cinematography and gorgeous music elevate the file, creating an audio-visual feast for the audience.

​		I hope you could appreciate this film and reap benefits from it.

​		The primary causes of my recommendation are as follows. To begin with, it is the best-loved of all the classical books of China and the most university popular. In addition, the book encapsulates the main tenets of Taoism, and upholds a way of being as well as a philosophy and a religion. The dominant image in the book is of the Way, the mysterious path through the whole cosmos modeled on the Milky Way that traverses the heavens.

## 2003年  

**温室里的花朵（人生哲理）**

​		The set of drawings above vividly depict the destiny of a flower in different circumstance. As is shown in the left cartoon, the flower is growing in full bloom in a comfortable greenhouse that shelters it from the threatening lighting and storm. On the contrary, when removed from the greenhouse and exposed to the driving rain, the flower soon fades and withers, with its petals scattered on the ground.

​		To begin with, the purpose of the drawings is to show us that the flower growing in the greenhouse cannot withstand the test of the storm. Yet the symbolic meaning subtly conveyed should be taken more seriously. The delicate flower is naturally associated with young people——to be specific, the only child in our current society——while the greenhouse epitomizes parents' doting care and abundant material supplies that can shield the children from the storms, which symbolize the harsh reality. Once the young people who have been doted on begin to seek independence and accept challenges from the real world, they are found too spoiled to be strong enough in the face of difficulties.

​		Accordingly, it is vital for us to derive positive implications from these thought-provoking drawings. On the one hand, we can use them to aid the youth to be more independent in life. On the other hand, parents should be sensible enough to give their children more freedom to deal with troubles and problems. Only by undergoing more challenges and toils in adversity can young people cultivate strong personalities and abilities, and only in this way can they become winners in this competitive world.

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2004年

**终点又是新的起点（人生哲理）**

​		It is vividly depicted in the cartoon that a boy is running along the racetrack with painful efforts, sweat pouring down his face. After a long race, he is making the final spurt toward the finishing line, with strong determination to become a champion. It seems that he can soon rest for a while to enjoy the ecstasy of victory. However, straight ahead lies a sign which indicates a new "starting point" and urges him to continue rushing to the next destination.

​		Undoubtedly, the cartoon conveys the meaning that life is like the process of running in which one should make constant efforts and never stop making progress. Owing to the quickening pace of life,competition is increasingly fierce in all walks of life, stimulating everyone to pursue one goal after another. Once a persons stops making progress, he can hardly maintain his past glory and survive in this competitive world. As Deng Xiaoping, the great Chinese leader said, "Development is inarguable truth." No matter how powerful a specific institution is, it must constantly seek new and speedy development. Generally speaking, neither a country nor a person can remain stagnant.

​		An illustration is closely related to us, the examinees. If we pass the National Entrance Test for MA/MS Candidates and then are confronted with the challenge of conquering the difficult graduate courses, we still have to strive for success in our future academic study and career. On the whole, this example effectively clarifies the saying that "the destination is another starting point."

**养老足球赛（社会热点）**

​		This picture reveals a not-uncommon phenomenon of how elders are treated by their grown-up children in some families in China. When they are too old to take care of themselves, the elders become burdens to be kicked around by their sons and daughters like a football, a pitiful and unjust sight that has aroused indignation among many Chinese.

​		As a nation renowned worldwide for its many virtues, China and the Chinese people have been practicing filial piety throughout history. Many often-told stories reiterate this time-honored virtue of loving and respecting the elders, such as the story of Tiying in the Western Han Dynasty who risked her life in order to save her wronged father from corporal punishment. Those who try every means to avoid their duties of looking after their elders should bear in mind that they are much indebted to their parents for their rearing. Without the loving care and selfless devotion of their parents, how could they have grown up healthily and become successful? How is it possible for them to maltreat their parents without the pricks of conscience?

​		Every one of us should live up to the virtues passed down to us by our ancestors. Only in this way can we be worthy of the name of a Chinese.

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2006年

**偶像崇拜（社会热点）**

​		As is vividly depicted in the photos above, Beckham, the smart British football superstar, is enjoying a striking popularity among adolescents. In the first picture, Beckham's name appears on a young man's face. The caption indicates that worship for an idol is written on his face. In the second photograph, another young person is in a barbershop getting his hair cut in Beckham's chic style. We are informed that he is spending 300 yuan imitating his idol's haircut.

​		Undoubtedly, the pictures subtly reflect the social phenomenon of idol worship prevalent among teenagers nowadays. Briefly speaking, young people are inclined to idolize the people who excel in appearance, intelligence of talent. Bechham represents the image of a sports hero, whose handsome appearance and unparalleled football skills are passionately adored by all the sports fans. Likewise, several teenage girls won their fame overnight in The 2005 Super Girl Contest in China, which provoked noisy nationwide debate on the value and harm of admiring these idols.

​		In my opinion, idolatry, a thought-provoking social phenomenon, is a double-edged sword which can exert profound influence for either good or bad on the growth of young people. In we simply worship idols by imitating their hairstyle of pursuing fashions unreasonably, the obsession will certainly waste a great deal of our time and money, endangering the efficiency of our study or work. On the contrary, if we endeavor to improve ourselves by bridging the gap between our models and us, we will lead a positive and fruitful life. Accordingly, the latter attitude should be adopted to direct our way of life.

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2007年

**点球大战（人生哲理）**

​		It is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon that a striker is preparing to shoot at the goal defended by a goalkeeper on a football field. In the goalkeeper's mind he is so much smaller that he actually is that guarding the goal becomes an impossible mission.    At the same time, the giant guard seems to fill up the whole goal in the attacking player's mind.

​		The purpose of the drawing is to show us that in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges of predicaments, possessing self-confidence is of the utmost significance. Regardless of how much success on has had in school of or at work, there are bound to be times when he or her will encounter problems. It is at these critical times that one's self confidence, toward difficulty and toward life in general, plays a crucial role in determining whether he or she can turn failure into victory.

​		I can think of no better illustration than the following one. Helen Keller was deaf and blind, certainly nothing to give her self-confidence. Nevertheless, she went on to conquer her multiple handicaps to finally become a writer and lecture, and an inspiration to all. This case effectively illustrates that no matter what tasks we are confronted with, we should never overestimate the difficulties or underestimate our abilities.

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2008年

**你一条腿我一条腿，走南闯北（人生哲理）**

​		As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, two handicapped adolescents, supporting each other with their firm hands, are continuing their new journey across the ground. Crutches left behind, they have successfully cracked the hard nut of lameness, which might have stumped the majority of the disabled. The caption indicates, "You have merely one leg and so do I. Helping each other, we can travel all around."

​		Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the portrayal that the cartoonist is trying to attract our attention to the issue of cooperation. According to a survey conducted among a group of people who were in the same college class 10 years ago, those who are ready to give their cooperation to others all become rich or attained managerial status in various fields, which not a single young man who had difficulty in getting along with his classmates became an executive or a boss. Why do those who are excellent in team work tend to be managers or run their own enterprise later in life? The answer seems self-evident. On the one hand, if you are competent in a profession, but have difficulty in getting along with your colleagues and even with your boss, you can hardly survive corporate life. On the other hand, your chances of success are much higher with a wide circle of friends who are willing to cooperate with you to provide information and resources.

​		It is my view that, first and foremost, we can use the drawing to aid juveniles in learning to cooperate successfully with each other. Furthermore, whatever difficulties or situations we are confronted with, we can remind ourselves that those who have the spirit of cooperation and team work are nearer to success. Just as John Adams, the second U.S. president, quoted from the ancient Greek Aesop's Fables, "United we stand, divided we fall."

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2009年

**网络的近与远（社会热点）**

​		As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, a large number of people are surfing on line within a stretching spider web, either to entertain themselves or to meet the needs of work. It seems rather ironic to present people separated from each other by the spider web when they attempt to communicate. Undoubtedly, the spider web serves as a symbol of the Internet, both connecting people and isolating them from each other.

​		The impressive metaphorical portrayal subtly reveals the duality of the relationship between man and the Internet. On the one hand, there is no denying that the Internet is currently one of the most efficient media used for interpersonal communication. As a college student, I get on line every day yo discuss news with other people on BBS, to study English by registering for web courses, and to chat freely with my friends through MSN Messenger. But on the other hand, a good many people admit that they are too addicted to the Internet to maintain face-to-face contact with their friends and colleagues. Once having indulged in the fictitious world, people feel reluctant to approach others and to concentrate on real life. That's why some people have lost the skill of direct contact and become alienated from others.

​		Hence, it is necessary for us to use the Internet in a reasonable way and restrain from overindulgence. After all, the Internet was invented to connect you and me, and to bring conveniences to our life rather than setting barriers to keep people beyond reach.

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2010年

**文化火锅（教育文化）**

​		As is symbolically illustrated in the portrayal, there is a boiling hot pot containing various ingredients of disparate cultures. These various cultures can be categorized as cultural celebrities home and abroad, such as Bi Sheng, Lao She, Shakespeare and Einstein; philosophical concepts such as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, benevolence, ritual, humanism, enlightenment, post-modernism and deconstructionism, as well as performing arts or works such as Peking Opera, Kung fu and Swan Lake. We are informed that the cultural "hot pot" is both delicious and nutritious.

​		The purpose of the cartoonist is to show us that instead of being considered outdated and of little value in a rapidly modernizing world, cultural blending should be encouraged and maintained. On the one hand, mosaic cultures are part of the University heritage of humanity and are powerful means of bringing together diverse peoples and social groups. Consequently, cultural integration has become indispensable as a means of promoting further culture development and preservation. On the other hand, for China and many other rapidly developing countries, there is a danger that age-old customs and traditions may become lost in the shadows of modernization. If Kung fu, Peking Opera or Swan Lake ever perished from the earth, it would be a tragedy of immeasurable proportions.

​		In my view, multi-cultures can be kept alive by the people with the time to do so, which is vital in ensuring a community's future development and prosperity. As a consequence of successful commercialization efforts, unwavering government support and growing interest overseas, the future of cultural blending looks brighter and more secure than ever before.

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2011年

**旅程之“余”（环境保护、社会热点）**

​		As is subtly portrayed in the cartoon, two tourists are sightseeing on a small boat while discarding their picnic leftovers casually into a lake. Unfortunately, the lake is already filled with litter and teeming with flowing rubbish like plastic containers, fish-bones, banana peels, watermelon rinds, bottles, tins, food wrappings, and so on. And below the drawing, there is a caption which says :"after" the travel or "me" in the travel.

​		From the portrayal, we can conclude that the painter wants to convey such a message: a good many scenic spots are flooded with visitors, who spoil the beauty of nature by creating and leaving behind God-knows-how-much trash. On the one hand, tourism, as a multibillion-dollar business, is booming everywhere. Some people, under the belief that tourism serves as an engine of economic growth, seem to ignore its negative effects on the environment. Nevertheless, these are not concerns that we can shrug off lightly. On the other hand, tourism has exerted great pressure on the environment we are living in : our water is polluted, our ecological system is disturbed, and our natural resources have been excessively used.

​		 Undoubtedly, tourism cannot be banned in any country, as it does help to shore up the economy in places which have few sources of income. However, the main point is that the unchecked growth of the travel business may render the development of an economy unsustainable. It is high time that we enhanced people's awareness to rectify this by taking environmental protection into consideration.

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2012年

**水撒了，两个人不同态度（人生哲理）**

​		As is symbolically demonstrated in the cartoon, two individuals respond to the same event in completely different ways. The person on the left airs his dissatisfaction and disappointment when a bottle is overturned, while the man on the right hurries to set it back up, with a sweet smile on his face. We are informed that various folks take different attitudes toward the same occurrence.

​		The aim of the portrayal is to illustrate that keeping optimistic is of utmost significance to our life. In the first place, optimism brings our creative power into play, arouses our enthusiasm for work and helps us overcome difficulties. Yet with pessimism, achievements can hardly be made. In the second place, keeping optimistic gives us light when we are in the dark, and encouragement when we are dismayed. It is optimism, rather than genius or extraordinary abilities, that inspires us to finish an arduous task. With optimism, the goals we set can be reached, and the hardest nut can be cracked.

​		In conclusion, being optimistic enables people to behave wisely, kindly, and confidently, and it is also crucial for any individual's development, in terms of both character and competence.



<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## 2013年

**选择（社会热点、人生哲理）**

​		As is vividly shown in the cartoon, for college students, choosing what to do upon graduation can be a tough decision, to say the least. For the vast majority of students, the choice is among finding a job, pursuing postgraduate studies, going abroad, and starting one's own business. Below the drawing, there is a caption which says : "Choice".

​		When making this decision, students should consider a variety of factors, including their personal preferences, financial status and career plans. The first factor that they should consider is their own personal preferences. Some students may have entrepreneurial ambitions and dreams of running their own business, The second factor that undergraduate students should consider is their financial situation. Some students can afford the tuition fees of postgraduate studies or studying overseas, while for others the expense would be too heavy a financial strain. The final factor that students should take into account is their intended career. Students who make the wrong choice could be faced with gloomy career prospects, or end up wasting their time and money.

​		When it comes to the decision by university graduates of their next step in life, there is no one right of wrong choice. Instead, each student must make his or her own decision. With due consideration of personal preferences, financial status and career goals, students can improve their chances of making an optimal choice.

**相携，养老问题（社会热点、文化教育）**

​		In the first cartoon, three decades ago, along the road walked a young and vigorous mother, leading her beloved daughter hand in hand, with a sweet smile on her beautiful face. On the contrary, in the second portrayal, the daughter in the prime of her life is now supporting her aged mother with her firm arm. And below the drawing, there is a caption which says : "Mutual Support".

​		The aim of the picture is to illustrate that practicing filial piety is of great importance in our current society. For one thing, we have inherited this world from our parents and grandparents. If not for the hard work of the past generations, including the aged among us, the modern society that we enjoy today would not have been possible. For another, the senior citizens have worked hard to provide for their families, for our society and for working conditions for posterity.

​		To sum up, it is a tradition in China to respect the elderly and to take care of the young. It can be exemplified by giving up our seats on the bus for someone old, by inviting our parents to live with us once they retire, and by listening to their advice on personal or work problems. Although some Chinese traditions are disappearing, one tradition which should never fade away is that of looking after the elderly.

**手机时代的聚会（社会热点）**

​		As is shown in the cartoon, four youngsters are sitting at a table, ready to have dinner. Unfortunately, instead of drinking and eating from a variety of delicious and nutritious dishes, each of them is holding a mobile phone and staring at the screen, with no thought to chat or eat at all. The caption informs us that the picture shows a typical gathering in an era of mobile phone.

​		Like the Internet, mobile phones have brought a lot of convenience to our lives. With mobile phones, the home can become a library, a school, an office and an entertainment center. All kinds of transactions, from banking to shopping, can be performed electronically, and all information, from train schedules to off-price merchandise, is as close as the press of a key. However, despite the increase in efficiency and convenience generated by digital products, the changes they bring could very well lead to potentially adverse consequences. For instance, as nearly all activities can be conducted on mobile phones, we might all become hermit-like, never feeling any need to leave our screens. This would be unfortunate because by becoming so addicted to the virtual world, we might never be exposed to social interactions.

​		From the preceding discussion, it is readily apparent that the mobile phone, as an increasingly popular tool of communication, has both its upsides and downsides. Admittedly, the mobile phone can be used in many productive and useful ways. However, people who lack self-control, such as adolescents, must limit the time they spend on digital products, or their academic work and social lives will eventually pay the price.

**与其提要求，不如做榜样，两代关系、言传身教（社会热点）**

​		In the picture above are a father and his beloved son. In the left-hand cartoon, the father, smoking a cigarette and sitting comfortably on a sofa, is watching a football match on TV and shouting, "son, you study hard for me!" On the contrary, in the right-hand portrayal, at 9 p.m., the father is studying together with his son, both totally absorbed in their books. The caption indicates, "Instead of merely making a request, set an example."

​		The purpose of the pictures is to show us that utmost significance should be attached to practicing what you preach. On the one hand, parents teach much more by their actions than by their words. Some of them may say to their children, "don't say four-lettter words about so and so", but before long the children may hear them criticize their friends and neighbours with bad language. On the other hand, parenting is such a crucial responsibility, yet there are no required courses to prepare one to undertake this role in life. The only learning children have is the example from their own parents.

​		To sum up, parents are the best teachers. Obviously, if parent's actions don't conflict with their own words, they will have the opportunity to be outstanding examples for their children. Just as an old saying goes, "Actions speak louder than words."

**有书与读书（社会热点）**

 		In the cartoon above are two men treating books in completely different ways. In the left-hand caricature, facing hundreds of books on the shelf, a man is speaking proudly, "I have so many books!" On the contrary, in the right-hand drawing, facing merely one book on the desk, another person is saying to himself, "I will exert my effort to finish reading 20 books this year." The cartoons are captioned :"owning books and reading books".

​		The aim of the portrayal is to show us that actions speak louder than words. Ambition is nothing without action whereas action as perfectly possible without ambition, as is evidenced by impulsive people. Let us consider for instance Leonardo Da Vinci. In his life he created many brilliant works of art and invented many machines, such as the helicopter, that surpassed the technology of his time. If he had only been an ambitious man, he would have no doubt left us only with nice artifacts. Yet, Da Vinci was a man of action who could not sit still, so he produced a dazzling legacy of paintings and inventions.

​		Generally speaking, ambition and action are both essential in determining whether we flourish or fall behind. The former gives us the drive and direction to move forward, while the latter enables us to take the initiative to implement our vision and make things happen. Just as the famous British philosopher John Locke said, "The actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts".

**选课进行时（社会热点、人生哲理）**

​		As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, a young student is sitting in front a computer. Browsing a course selective system on line, he is considering whether to choose courses with new knowledge, emphasizing on innovation and having difficulty or to choose courses that are easy to pass with high scores and little homework. The caption indicates : "Selecting Courses".

​		The portrayal is intended to tell us that when people face an either-or choice, some are intimidated by difficulty and take a shortcut, while others deem them as good opportunities to strengthen their will. For one thing, the struggle with difficulties will lead you out of the impasse to a brilliant future. For instance, in 1993, J. K. Rowling, unemployed and with clinical depression, had even planned to commit suicide in despair. Fortunately, she did not give up, and it was under such circumstances that she began to create what later became the best-selling Harry Potter series. For another, difficulties also teach people to cherish their life. But for the hardships in her life, Helen Keller wouldn't have written the famous article Three Days to see.

​		In summary, difficulty is an unavoidable part of everyone's life, and the triumph over it will make you an unbeatable person. Just as the famous German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote in his Twilight of the Idols :"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."

**途中（人生哲理）**

​		It is subtly revealed in the cartoon that two young people are on their painstaking journey up a mountain. Sitting on the stairs with sweat pouring down his face, the person on the right says, "I'm too tired to climb anymore." In contrary, stretching out his hand and giving his partner a bottle of water, the man on the left responds, "Don't do that! Take a rest and then we can continue." The caption indicates : "On the road."

​		The intention of the portrayal is to show us that utmost significance must be attached to persistence and perseverance. On account of the quickening pace of life, competition is becoming increasingly fierce in all walks of life, imposing tremendous pressure on all individuals. The past few years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the difficulty of examinations and employment. We must maintain persistence and perseverance in the face of challenges so as to survive and succeed. Suppose we are inclined to overestimate our rivals or problems and neglect our ability, we will become hesitant and doubtful about ourselves, unable to fulfill even a simple task.

​		Hence, it is imperative to embrace the strong faith that we are indomitable and invincible. As the saying goes, our only enemy is ourselves. Only by making constant efforts and never stopping making progress can we show grace under pressure and turn our dreams into reality.

**尽早完成才放心、不到最后不动手（人生哲理）**

​		It is portrayals above are two young people behaving completely differently in the face of difficulties. In the left cartoon, a lovely young lady is sitting at a desk with a great many books on it and working hard, saying, "I will be content until I accomplish my task as soon as possible." In contrast, in the right drawing, a young man is lying lazily on a sofa and doing nothing, saying, "I will not start my work until the last moment." And below the pictures, there is a caption which says :"Habit".

​		The intention of the caricatures is to show us that forming good habits is of utmost significance in our daily life. To begin with, people who know how to form good habits will be able to ensure strong academic performance. As an illustration, those students who prioritize their commitments, schedule their time reasonably and avoid procrastination are certain to make steady gains in their grades. What is more, forming excellent habits can help us to develop confidence and to maintain a healthy mental state. In other words, forming good habits can play a key role in keeping us spiritually fit and reducing the pressure and anxiety that accompany modern life for most young people.

​		Generally speaking, forming good habits is essential to us in several ways, including helping us to excel in our studies, lead an active social life, and maintain optimal mental health.

**爸爸，好多同学觉得唱戏不好玩（文化教育）**

​		In the portrayal above are a handsome father and his beloved son. Dressed in a Monkey King costume, the lovely boy is murmuring sadly, "Dad, many of my classmates don't think that learning Peking opera is appealing." Smiling at his son, the father answers, "Don't you enjoy it yourself? That's enough."

​		The intention of the cartoon is to show us that due attention should be attached to our interest. To begin with, there is power in interest. Interest can lead people to the paths they should choose and can endow them with passion. It can instill enthusiastic love of life and put a sparkle in our eyes, or a lilt in our voice. It can also smooth the wrinkles from our souls. Besides, we are born with wide-eyed, enthusiastic wonder. It is this childlike wonder that gives enthusiastic people such a youthful air, no matter how old they are. Finally, interest is something that you feel happy to hold on to. People with interest love what they do, regardless of economic rewards, power, or celebrity.

​		In short, God gives each bird its food, but he does not throw that food into its nest. Whatever you are interested in, just cherish it and let you dream be realized.
